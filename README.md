## Note

- To summarize the status of NCL, the project is "**feature frozen**".
- NCAR has made the decision to adopt Python as the scripting language platform of choice for future development of analysis and visualization tools.

And then, open the Color Theme picker with **File** > **Preferences** > **Color Theme**.
